microsoft excel,10,4,10,

basketball,9,8,6,
hot dog eating contest,9,10,3,theres strategy with how/when you drink water etc. number of hotdogs eaten in time

dance,3,9,4,
reading,,3,,
jump rope,,,,
bouldering,6,10,9,"bouldering i'd put physical exertion very high (think high intensity interval training but you're climbing a wall) and mental exertion also pretty high, since it's a lot of problem solving on figuring out good beta for the problem

objectivity kinda depends, there's no ""set"" scoring method for competition afaik, so if we're going by personal it's mostly objective whether you complete the problem but for a competition it might be a bit arbitrary how they assign points"
top rope climbing,,9,8,"top rope and lead climbing are similar to bouldering, maybe slightly less mental and about the same or more physical exertion? think the difference between running 100m and running a mile, bouldering is like 100m sprints, top rope is the mile"
lead climbing,,9,8,"top rope and lead climbing are similar to bouldering, maybe slightly less mental and about the same or more physical exertion?"
Hockey,9,6,6,ice movement is probably slightly easier as you can glide and use your momentum more
Lacrosse,9,7,6,about the same physically and objectively as soccer
