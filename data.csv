archery,9,8,9,
badminton,9,8,4,
baseball,9,7,5,some people stand around most of the game
basketball,9,8,6,
bouldering,6,10,9,"bouldering i'd put physical exertion very high (think high intensity interval training but you're climbing a wall) and mental exertion also pretty high, since it's a lot of problem solving on figuring out good beta for the problem

objectivity kinda depends, there's no ""set"" scoring method for competition afaik, so if we're going by personal it's mostly objective whether you complete the problem but for a competition it might be a bit arbitrary how they assign points"
bowling,9,5,4,less physical than basketball

top rope climbing,,9,8,"top rope and lead climbing are similar to bouldering, maybe slightly less mental and about the same or more physical exertion? think the difference between running 100m and running a mile, bouldering is like 100m sprints, top rope is the mile"
